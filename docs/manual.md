1. Focus graph and context graph
2. Buoyant layout
(not sure how detailed the first two sections needs to be as they overlaps a lot with the paper, you probably have most material from your website)

# Navigation features of AEGIS
1. Main panels
2. Graph layout
such as a node represents a GO term etc.
3. Basic features
