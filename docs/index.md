This is the documentation webpage for AEGIS. AEGIS is an open-source software with an interactive information-retrieval framework that enables an investigator to navigate through the entire Gene Ontology (GO) graph (with tens of thousands of nodes) and focus on fine-grained details without losing the context. It features interpretable visualization of GO terms reported from studies, flexible exploratory analysis of the GO DAG, as well as principled power analysis that is biologically relevant.
