AEGIS is an open-source software with an interactive information-retrieval framework that enables an investigator to navigate through the entire Gene Ontology (GO) graph (with tens of thousands of nodes) and focus on fine-grained details without losing the context. It features interpretable visualization of GO terms reported from studies, flexible exploratory analysis of the GO DAG, as well as principled power analysis that is biologically relevant. Getting Started Accompanied with our user manual and video tutorials , there are two options to explore the visualization by AEGIS: the lite version and the full version. The lite version A light weight version of AEGIS is available as a web interface here . It includes the minimal interactive features with some examples for simple demonstrations. The lite version does not require installation and serves as an introduction to our visualization concepts. The full version The full version includes all features, including data upload and power analysis functions. This version is meant to be installed locally and include more customization and computationally intensive processes. The code is open source with api documentation so advanced pipelines can customize it to their needs. Behind the Name According to Greek Mythology , Perseus used Athena\u2019s shield to look at Medusa's reflection without being petrified. This shield that empowered Perseus to defeat Medusa later became the AEGIS. To see the object of interest in a way that is manageable and informative, one cannot directly \u201clook at it,\u201d but appropriate visualization tools are needed. The modern concept of doing something \"under someone's aegis\" means doing something under the protection of a powerful, knowledgeable, or benevolent source. By combining visualization with the rich knowledge in the Gene Ontology, we hope to offer scientists a new tool to discover hidden patterns and uncover the gems in their data. Minerve remettant \u00e0 Pers\u00e9e son bouclier avec lequel il doit combattre La M\u00e9duse by Houasse Ren\u00e9 Antoine ( Image Source ) The Gene Ontology The Gene Ontology (GO) is one of the most popular biological databases. It consists of two continuously evolving elements: (1) a collection of controlled biological terms with semantic hierarchical relationships and (2) annotations that link genes and gene products to specific terms. The GO can be represented as a graph where each node represents a GO term, and each directed link pointing from a parent to a child represents the semantic relationship with two terms. The child term can be related to the parent term via an \u201cis a\u201d, \u201cpart of\u201d or \u201cregulates\u201d relation. There are three root nodes: \u201cbiological process\u201d, \u201cmolecular function\u201d and \u201ccellular component\u201d, and each of their descendants are connected with directed edges in an acyclic fashion. Genes can be simultaneously annotated to different terms, and their annotations propagate upwards in the hierarchy, resulting in the gene sets in the nodes. For more detailed information about the GO, please visit the GO Consortium and the GO Handbook . Contact Us AEGIS is developed and maintained by Junjie (Jason) Zhu in the Sabatti Lab at Stanford University . Both Qian Zhao and Eugene Katsevich have also contributed to the development of this project. You can find the contact information at the webpages or via Github issues.

The following instructions are used to install the full version of AEGIs, which includes all of its functionalities including power calculation. Install Dependencies Prerequisites : Python3 (required), virtualenv or other package managements (recommended). The code is available on github, so you can directly clone the repository to your local: git clone git@github.com:junjiezhujason/aegis.git Installing of dependencies only requires one line: pip3 install -r requirements.txt AEGIS also requires specification of a folder: ${LOCALPATH} to store the cached files. This is mainly for version control and speed performance. For most of the analyses (excluding simulation outputs), the files will typically require no more than 250M of disk space. Note : If this is the first time that you are running AEGIS locally, Internet connection will be required to download data (or our cached files below) from the online databases. Download Caches (Optional) You can manually pre-propagate some local files in ${LOCALPATH} to reduce setup time. Once the cache is stored, most features of AEGIS can be performed locally without Internet connection for ontology or data download. Simply download the light cache files of (version-controlled) species/ontologies here and unpack to the directory ${LOCALPATH} , e.g., local_${VERSION}.tar.gz Make sure to expand the files in the ${LOCALPATH} so that the folder includes them in the following format: ${LOCALPATH}/local/godag_*.pkl Here is an example of the command line workflow: cd ${LOCALPATH} wget http://stanford.edu/~jjzhu/fileshare/aegis/local_20180710.tar.gz tar -xvzf local_20180710.tar.gz The local directory should have the following structure, for example: ${LOCALPATH}/local/godag-biological_process-human-20180719.pkl ${LOCALPATH}/local/godag-biological_process-mouse-20180719.pkl ${LOCALPATH}/local/godag-cellular_component-human-20180719.pkl ${LOCALPATH}/local/godag-cellular_component-mouse-20180719.pkl ${LOCALPATH}/local/godag-molecular_function-human-20180719.pkl ${LOCALPATH}/local/godag-molecular_function-mouse-20180719.pkl Here 20180719 represents the version number of the ontology paired with the annotation. It is highly useful for reproducing any results from the GO as well as AEGIS. Note : If you skip this step, the latest version of the GO and annotation files will be downloaded, and the total setup time will take longer. Launch the Local Server To launch the server, run: python3 main.py --port 5000 --folder ${LOCALPATH} Note : both the port number and the local path options are required. If this is your first time running AEGIS and you did not download our cached files, AEGIS will automatically download the latest gene and go annotations. This may take a while, and the following extra files will be automatically generated inside the local directory: ${LOCALPATH}/local/gene2go ${LOCALPATH}/local/go-basic.obo ${LOCALPATH}/local/geneid2sym_human.json ${LOCALPATH}/local/geneid2sym_mouse.json and later, the program will also generate the cached files ${LOCALPATH}/local/godag-*-*-*.pkl The version number will be based on the date the files are downloaded and when the .pkl file is created. By default, AEGIS will continue this version if the same ${LOCALPATH} is specified. To update the version, simply create a new local path to repeat the analysis above.

The demonstration is performed within the AEGIS LITE interface, which is available here . Interactions to Explore the GO This tutorial demonstrates how to explore the GO without any data inputs. It also demonstrates how to use the search auto-complete, customize some of the visualizations, and select functionally related gene sets (used for a single-cell analysis simulation, for example). The demonstration is performed within the AEGIS LITE interface, which is available here . Power Analysis Workflow This tutorial illustrates the interactive workflow to setup the power analysis with AEGIS.
