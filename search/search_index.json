The following instructions are used to install the full version of AEGIs, which includes all of its functionalities including power calculation. Install Dependencies Prerequisites : Python3 (required), virtualenv or other package managements (recommended). The code is available on github, so you can directly clone the repository to your local: git clone git@github.com:junjiezhujason/aegis.git Installing of dependencies only requires one line: pip3 install -r requirements.txt AEGIS also requires specification of a folder: ${LOCALPATH} to store the cached files. This is mainly for version control and speed performance. For most of the analyses (excluding simulation outputs), the files will typically require no more than 250M of disk space. Note : If this is the first time that you are running AEGIS locally, Internet connection will be required to download data (or our cached files below) from the online databases. Download Caches (Optional) You can manually pre-propagate some local files in ${LOCALPATH} to reduce setup time. Once the cache is stored, most features of AEGIS can be performed locally without Internet connection for ontology or data download. Simply download the light cache files of (version-controlled) species/ontologies here and unpack to the directory ${LOCALPATH} , e.g., local_${VERSION}.tar.gz Make sure to expand the files in the ${LOCALPATH} so that the folder includes them in the following format: ${LOCALPATH}/local/godag_*.pkl Here is an example of the command line workflow: cd ${LOCALPATH} wget http://stanford.edu/~jjzhu/fileshare/aegis/local_20180710.tar.gz tar -xvzf local_20180710.tar.gz Note : If you skip this step, the latest version of the GO and annotation files will be downloaded, and the total setup time will take longer. Launch the Local Server To launch the server, run: python3 main.py --port 5000 --folder ${LOCALPATH} Note : both the port number and the local path options are required. If this is your first time running AEGIS and you did not download our cached files, AEGIS will automatically download the latest gene and go annotations. This may take a while, and the following files will be automatically generated inside the local directory: ${LOCALPATH}/local/gene2go ${LOCALPATH}/local/go-basic.obo ${LOCALPATH}/local/geneid2sym_human.json ${LOCALPATH}/local/geneid2sym_mouse.json and later, the program will also generate the cached files ${LOCALPATH}/local/godag_*.pkl By default, AEGIS will continue this version if the same ${LOCALPATH} is specified. To update the version, simply create a new local path to repeat the analysis above. Finally, open your local browser with http://localhost:5000/","title":"Installation"},{"location":"install/#install-dependencies","text":"Prerequisites : Python3 (required), virtualenv or other package managements (recommended).

It also offers as simple demonstration of how to switch highlighting functions and the focus graph. The data example is based on significant GO terms (within the biological process ontology) identified from a GWAS study. The demonstration is performed within the AEGIS LITE interface, which is available here . Overview of Graph Layouts This tutorial gives an overview of the graph layouts, and some of the interactions on the focus graphs implemented in AEGIS. In particular, the buoyant layout is featured and compared with two other layouts: the root-bound and the leaf-bound layouts. The data example is based on enriched GO terms (within the cellular component ontology) from a ChIP-seq study. The demonstration is performed within the AEGIS LITE interface, which is available here . Interactions to Explore the GO This tutorial demonstrates how to explore the GO without any data inputs. It also demonstrates how to use the search auto-complete, customize some of the visualizations, and select functionally related gene sets (used for a single-cell analysis simulation, for example). The demonstration is performed within the AEGIS LITE interface, which is available here . Power Analysis Workflow This tutorial illustrates the interactive workflow to setup the power analysis with AEGIS. It demonstrates how to customize the context graph to determine the terms to be tested. It also demonstrates how to highlight non-null GO terms based on the signal gene set selection within the interface. The demonstration is performed within the full AEGIS interface, which requires local installation.","title":"Video Tutorials"},{"location":"tutorial/#focus-and-context-graphs","text":"This tutorial introduces the concept of focus and context graphs, and how they can render results from existing GO analysis pipelines.
